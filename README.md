### RNG for a real bbc using disk drive timings

Why? Yeah...I wonder.

So, for comedy value I'd like to use a real BBC Master to make random numbers using:

- Mersenne Twister (full version!)
- Entropy/seeding from real timings of seeking a physical disk drive to various files

So far I have a terrible LFSR, but I'm hoping to paste-in some stellar work from Claude.ai to get the Mersenne Twister.
